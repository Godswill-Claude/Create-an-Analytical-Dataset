# Create-an-Analytical-Dataset
This project aims to perform advanced data cleaning operations on three sets of data to get them to each become an analytical dataset, so that we can be able to decide which city will be chosen as the location for Pawdacityâ€™s newest (14th) store. The 14th store should be located in the city whose predicted yearly sales is found to be the highest.
